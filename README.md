# Flashlight
A short 2D game I made during a 24hr Two-Input Game Jam.

Spam the left and right arrow keys to move the flashlight left and right to ward off the monsters. Press both arrows to use a camera flash. The music gets louder as the monsters get closer.

Just download the Data folder, the exe, and the Unity dll file and then click the exe!
